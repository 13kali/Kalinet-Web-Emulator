; *** MAIN ***
;
; THIS IS THE MAIN LOOP THAT COLLECTS THE TINY BASIC PROGRAM
; AND STORES IT IN THE MEMORY.
;
; AT START, IT PRINTS OUT "(CR)OK(CR)", AND INITIALIZES THE
; STACK AND SOME OTHER INTERNAL VARIABLES.  THEN IT PROMPTS
; ">" AND READS A LINE.  IF THE LINE STARTS WITH A NON-ZERO
; NUMBER, THIS NUMBER IS THE LINE NUMBER.  THE LINE NUMBER
; (IN 16 BIT BINARY) AND THE REST OF THE LINE (INCLUDING CR)
; IS STORED IN THE MEMORY.  IF A LINE WITH THE SAME LINE
; NUMBER IS ALREADY THERE, IT IS REPLACED BY THE NEW ONE.  IF
; THE REST OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF A CR ONLY, IT IS NOT STORED
; AND ANY EXISTING LINE WITH THE SAME LINE NUMBER IS DELETED.
;
; AFTER A LINE IS INSERTED, REPLACED, OR DELETED, THE PROGRAM
; LOOPS BACK AND ASKS FOR ANOTHER LINE.  THIS LOOP WILL BE
; TERMINATED WHEN IT READS A LINE WITH ZERO OR NO LINE
; NUMBER; AND CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO "DIRECT".
;
; TINY BASIC PROGRAM SAVE AREA STARTS AT THE MEMORY LOCATION
; LABELED "TXTBGN" AND ENDS AT "TXTEND".  WE ALWAYS FILL THIS
; AREA STARTING AT "TXTBGN", THE UNFILLED PORTION IS POINTED
; BY THE CONTENT OF A MEMORY LOCATION LABELED "TXTUNF".
;
; THE MEMORY LOCATION "CURRNT" POINTS TO THE LINE NUMBER
; THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING INTERPRETED.  WHILE WE ARE IN
; THIS LOOP OR WHILE WE ARE INTERPRETING A DIRECT COMMAND
; (SEE NEXT SECTION). "CURRNT" SHOULD POINT TO A 0.
